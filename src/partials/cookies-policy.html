                            A cookie is a text entry that a web server places in the client device's 
                            persistent memory. Typically, cookies are used to support authorized sessions 
                            or to configure a custom interface, font size, color scheme, site language, 
                            etc., to preserve your preferences and generally provide a more comfortable 
                            usage of the site. A web beacon, also called an Internet tag, a pixel tag, or 
                            a blank GIF file, is used to return information to a web server.<br><br>
                            Visiting and using this site is completely anonymous. We collect mostly 
                            statistics on popular pages, site database searches, bug information and other 
                            impersonal data to further improve our services. We may also use cookies to 
                            collect information, which may include browser type, operating system, IP 
                            addresses, link source of URL, and information about actions taken with our

                            The purpose is to enable the site to remember your preferences (such as username 
                            and password, language, etc.) for a certain period. That way, you don’t have to

                            There are some cookies that we must include for certain web pages to function. 
                            For this reason, they do not require your consent. In particular: authentication 
                            cookies and technical cookies (required by certain IT systems). Authentication 
                            cookies are stored when you log in to the Site. When you do this, you accept

                            our websites and other digital resources. Therefore, in addition to its own 
                            cookies, this site may store other additional files due to the use of 
                            third-party services, such as Google Analytics and others.

                            gathering information about your actions with our websites and digital resources, which 
                            will be used to show you promotional materials based on your personal preferences.

                            The Analytics cookies simply assess how you interact with our website – as an anonymous

                            with any third parties or used for any other purpose. The anonymized statistics could 
                            be shared with contractors working on communication projects under contractual agreement
